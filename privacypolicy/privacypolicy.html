            This is the privacy policy page for Babipoki's Generators. For all intents and purposes, <b>I</b> (Babipoki) will refer to myself as <b>we</b>, but I only represent myself. The goal is to provide a clear and transparent way on how your data is being handled. We try to be as transparent as possible.<br><br>

            <b>What information do we collect?</b><br>
            We collect only the basic Google's search console data, which is your search query which got into our site, the pages you clicked on, the country you're from and devices you visited the site with.<br><br>

            <b>How do we use the information?</b><br>
            We have no commercial use for this information. We simply have it there to optimize our search results.<br><br>

            <b>What information do you share?</b><br>
            The only receiving parties of this information is me(Babipoki) and Google(for functionality of the search console).<br><br>

            <b>What information do we NOT collect?</b><br>
            We do not collect the generated results, your inputs, and neither do we collect screencaps or any of the sort for the pages you visit.<br><br>

            <b>How do I request to remove my data?</b><br>
            Sadly, this isn't a possibility, because the data is anonymous. We do not collect your user ID, email or any other form of identification, except for your country(which you can choose to opt out from sharing using your Google account or internet provider).
